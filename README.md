#### Scope
- [driveshare-gui](https://github.com/Storj/driveshare-gui) is the GUI of the DriveShare application, written with [Kivy](http://kivy.org/).
- [downstream-node](https://github.com/Storj/downstream-node) is a verification node for the files. Typically runs on a [MetaDisk](https://github.com/Storj/MetaDisk/) server. 
- [downstream-farmer](https://github.com/Storj/downstream-farmer) is a library and command line for utility for framers to complete challenges from the verifications nodes.
- [heartbeat](https://github.com/storj/heartbeat) is a Python library for verifying existence of a file on a remote computer.
